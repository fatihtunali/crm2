- Gap: Some endpoints still accept `X-Tenant-Id` header (admin tooling) - needs separation

**Filtering & Sorting**
- Current: Basic filters exist (`?status=`, `?sort=`) ✅
- Gap: Not standardized format, inconsistent across endpoints

**Soft Delete**
- Current: Providers have archive support ✅
- Gap: Not consistent across all resources (clients, agents, bookings, etc.)

**Reports**
- Current: 22 comprehensive report endpoints ✅
- Gap: Some lack pagination, may need async for heavy aggregations

## Next Steps

1. **Review this analysis** - Validate priorities and timeline
2. **Choose starting phase** - Option A, B, or C
3. **Create detailed technical specs** - For chosen phase
4. **Set up task tracking** - Break down into 2-3 day tasks
5. **Begin implementation** - With regular checkpoints

## Questions for Decision

1. **Timeline:** Do you have a target launch date or milestone?
2. **Team size:** Will this be solo development or team-based?
3. **Priority:** Revenue (Option B), Reliability (Option A), or Compliance (Option C)?
4. **Turkish market:** Is e-invoice compliance critical now or can it wait?
5. **Payment gateways:** Which PSP are you planning to integrate (iyzico, PayU, Stripe)?
6. **Async jobs:** Do you have a preference for job queue (BullMQ, pg-boss, or simple DB polling)?
